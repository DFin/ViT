# ViT


So far mini-ViT.py is a small standalone implementation of a transformer for MNIST handwriting recognotion in pytorch. The intention is to build a full Vision Transformer from the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929). This is mostly for my own education to learn about transformers in computer vision, but maybe someone else profits from this.
