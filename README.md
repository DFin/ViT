So far this is an implementation of a simple transformer for MNIST handwriting recognotion. With the intention to build a full Vision Transformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) from there. This is mostly for my own education learning transformer usage in computer vision, but maybe someone else profits from this.
